-----
(1) process_cal.c submitted and named appropriately; compiles
without errors or warnings.

- Yes, the submitted file is correct, and the code
  compiles successfully without errors or warnings.

-----
(2) Tests passed (and further comments)

- Minimal or no critical differences in the produced output when
  compared with the expected one for some tests. Be careful with the spacing,
  management of special characters, and general formatting of the output
  produced by your program. It makes the difference between your tests
  passing or failing. For this time, we are considering the tests as passed.

-----
(3) Code formatting and structure:

 Positive aspects:

- Good formatting and structure of the code that facilitates reading
  and understanding.

- Basic attempt at documenting the code using comments to describe
  important aspects of the solution.

Improvement opportunities:

- It is a good practice to name variables and functions in a consistent
  and meaningful way. This will increase the maintainability of your code.

- Instead of having large functions, it is a good practice to divide
  your program into small pieces of functionality defined in
  well-defined functions. Functions should have a unique intention and a
  very clear scope. This facilitates the re-usability and maintainability
  of your code.

- It is always a good idea to minimize the length of your main()
  function to facilitate the re-usability of your code. A large or
  considerably big main() function might indicate that some portions of
  code in the function might placed in independent functions, which
  might potentially reused in the future. 

- In the future, please write documentation and comments at a level and
  granularity that will prove the most useful. One approach to this is
  to pretend you are writing notes to yourself six months in the future,
  someone who would need to understand what you did that cannot be
  immediately discerned from the text of the program itself.
