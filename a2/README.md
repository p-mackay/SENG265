# SENG 265 Assignment 2

#### This assignment: 

**process_cal.py: Returning to the problem**

1. For this assignment, please use the problem description as provided at the end of this document and
use the test files provided to test your program. Some of the limits of Assignment 1 that were placed on
certain values are no longer needed (e.g., maximum number of events, maximum line length, etc.).

2. The arguments used for the Python script are similar to the ones used for Assignment 1. That is, you will
indicate the range of dates to be used to generate the schedule by providing “--start” and “--end”
arguments. However, the executable will now be named “process_cal2.py” (and not “process_cal.py”)
and you will need to provide the names (i.e., paths) of two additional files (i.e., circuits.xml and
broadcasters.xml)

3. As opposed to the first assignment, the output of your program won’t be stdout to avoid previous issues
with the Unix diff command. Your program must generate a file called output.yaml that is compliant
with the YAML standard.
